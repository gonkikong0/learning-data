🧩 Python Visualization Practice

My public journal of learning data visualization in Python and exploring how code can bring data to life.

📚 About This Project

Welcome to my Python Visualization Practice repository!
This is part of my continuous learning journey — where I explore how Python can be used to generate, analyze, and visualize data.

The exercises and code here are inspired by the “Generating Data” chapter of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. Each file represents a small step in understanding how random data, probability, and visualization techniques can be modeled and displayed through Python.

I believe in learning by doing — and sharing that learning publicly to track progress and help others who are on a similar journey.

🚀 What This Project Covers

This repository includes a collection of Python scripts and visual experiments that demonstrate how to create, manipulate, and visualize data programmatically.

You’ll find examples such as:

🎲 Rolling Dice Simulations: Modeling probability using one or more dice and visualizing results through histograms.

🔢 Random Walks: Generating random data paths and exploring how simple randomness can form complex patterns.

📈 Scatter Plots and Line Charts: Displaying relationships and trends between generated data points.

🧮 Matplotlib and Plotly Visualizations: Learning how different libraries handle plotting and interactivity.

🧠 Concepts Learned

How to generate datasets programmatically using Python.

The basics of data visualization using matplotlib and plotly.

How to represent randomness and probability through random walks and dice simulations.

Building an intuition for how visuals can reveal data patterns better than raw numbers.

🧰 Tools & Libraries

Python — Core programming language

Matplotlib — For 2D plotting and visual exploration

Plotly — For interactive charts and histograms

Random — To generate random values and model stochastic behavior

🧭 Learning Reflection

Generating your own datasets with code is a powerful way to model and explore real-world situations.
Through these exercises, I’ve learned that visualization is not just about charts — it’s about telling a story with data, understanding randomness, and building the foundation for more advanced analytics and simulation projects in the future.

🤝 Note

This repository is intended purely for learning and sharing knowledge.
Feel free to explore the code, try out the visualizations, and use the examples as references for your own learning.
